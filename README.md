This is a repo for Udacity - Tensorflow course.

Regression:
1. Celsius to Fahrenheit: Given a set of input and output, this model predicts the relation between input and output.

Classification:
1. Fashion MNIST: Given a set of clothes images, and their types, it checks if the model predicts the image type.
  Here if we try to change the learning rate and epochs, test accuracy varies.
  If the epochs number is large, the model will start memorizing the dataset.
  
2. Fashion MNIST CNN: In this model we are using the same data set as above but we are using CNN model for the prediction.
  Test accuracy has improved using CNN.
